crDroid 9.2 hotfix 1

Changelog since v9.2 release:
- Device trees/hardware/kernel/vendor changes pulled from LineageOS.
  - Including, sadly, SPECTRE v2 mitigation. Ugh. Hopefully it's not too impactful.
- crDroid: Added framework-level app lock support! Now your "locked" apps *should* require biometric/PIN/Pattern unlock regardless of what launcher you're using, and depending on launcher, will also be hidden in more than just "crDroid Home".
- WiFi tuning! Tweaked RSSI threasholds, estimated throughput weighting, and some kernel firmware tunables in the cfg.ini to favor 5GHz networks more. When you're within range of both 2.4GHz and 5GHz saved networks, it should more strongly prefer to connect and stay connected to 5GHz networks unless they're really unusable.
- Re-commonized a couple of NFC config XMLs in preparation for upstream changes from LineageOS. Hopefully we're closer to having some more complicated NFC transactions (like some government ID authentication apps) that are currently failing finally start to work under Android 13 with source-built NFC HAL, since it's not possible to switch back to prebuilt like in Android 12.
- Tighten up burnInProtection horizontal & vertical ranges AGAIN arglebargleasdfwtfbbq!!1!1one.
- Reverted a stack of camera-related commits that bananafunction had backported from newer OnePlus device kernel releases, that could be responsible for some folks getting Qualcomm Crashdump mode with extensive camera usage. Should behave itself better now.
- Added a little more Steam power to this 01 April release.

Known issues:
- Upstream crDroid/LineageOS things:
  - Carrier name *still* goes off on walkabout under the rounded corners on lockscreen after a bit, I'm done fighting with it. I've opened the issue and sent screenshots and tried alternate implementations. I have a couple of problematic framework commits reverted, which helps with the statusbar & navbar when unlocked, but keyguard view is still messed up. We've now reached the end of my ability to fix stuff, and are waiting for an upstream resolution from the ROM team now.
  - Custom fonts in crDroid Settings don't get reapplied to everything on reboot; need to select a different font & then back to preferred font after restarting.
  - There might occasionally be icons that don't work when "Themed Icons" is enabled in crDroid Home settings. If home screen keeps going black and then reloading, open Settings, then go to Apps > Default Apps, and click the gear next to "crDroid Home" to open our built-in launcher settings, and toggle off "Themed Icons" for now. Send me the crash report URL (paste.crdroid.net) or MatLog zip and it'll tell me which icon needs to get fixed.
  - If you have SetupWizard installed as part of your Google Apps package, then enable Multiple Users and create a new Guest User, the "Setup Wizard" activity will fail to run at the end of the new profile creation, which will leave a couple props unset that normally tell Android that you've finished initial setup; and you won't be able to interact with the notifications/QS shade & will only have the "back" button in the navbar. You can either wait 10 minutes and it automagically fixes itself, or exit the "Guest session" without deleting data, and the next time you enter it, you'll have full control over navigation & statusbar/shades. This seems to be a limitation on multiple custom ROMs currently.
- I don't know if this is an upstream issue or device-specific or certain Google Apps packages, but Google Assistant Hotword Detection/Voice Match causes media playback stutter sometimes. So you can either disable it, or doing an adb sideload installation rather than update seems to help some people (permissions issue in Android 13? who knows).
- People don't read documentation.
- You tell me, with logs!

Installation notes:
- In case of bootloop (boot animation stuck for longer than about 2 minutes and never gets to lock screen), reboot to recovery and manually flash the ROM zip either via ADB sideload from computer, or from a FAT32-formatted USB thumb drive via OTG, then reboot to recovery again, and re-flash your same Google Apps/microG/Magisk/whatever install zips (again via ADB sideload or USB OTG), and reboot system. This *should* take care of any lingering errors with old things getting stuck in your /system/addon.d/ directory that might be trying to preserve old privileged system apps without privileged permissions (which is what causes those boot loops in the first place).
- The built-in OTA updater in Settings > System > Updater goes a lot faster if you go into Updater preferences and toggle on "prioritize updater process", and make sure the screen stays on by using the Caffeine QS tile, or "never sleep while charging" toggle in Developer Options, or changing your Display timeout to 30 minutes.
