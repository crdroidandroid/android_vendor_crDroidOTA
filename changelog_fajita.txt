crDroid 9.9

Changelog since v9.8 (03 September) release:
- September 2023 Android Security Bulletin (android-13.0.0_r75) merged from AOSP.
- Upstream changes to ROM sources from LineageOS & crDroid merged.
- crDroid:
  - So technically it wasn't merged until just this last week, but I got a fix in for the "merge" button missing from crDroid stock dialer, so you can create conference calls without having to use a 3rd-party dialer again, woo!
- Any device-specific device trees/hardware/kernel/vendor changes pulled from LineageOS.
  - Technically, the Lineage folks updated QTI thermal HAL temperature limits for SDM845.
  - Not much? I dunno, Edwin is busy on the 4.19 kernel bringup as a prerequisite for Android 14 right now.
- Device-specific:
  - I think I figured out the two things that kept causing all the battery drain after ~3 days of uptime. It's not doing it any more, FINALLY.
  - Updated kernel commits from bananafunction's lineage-20-test branch.
  - Since Google Photos was still freaking out about device overheating even with the more lax "skin" threshold limits in hardware/qcom, I imported HAL into device tree and changed it to use a different sensor name instead ('quiet-therm-adc' instead of 'xo-therm-adc'; still has safe shutdown limits but doesn't automatically set off a warning in Google Photos when trying to do a backup). Now we get a little better performance/temperature control, rather than just dropping the HAL entirely.
  - Played with kernel graphics-related commits and performance tuning stuff from PixelExperience and even MCD kernel a lot, and ultimately, I think I ended up paring back more things that I'd added in recent months. Battery life seems fine, reponsiveness/smoothness is good, reduced some jankiness when under load, even Golf Blitz seems to stop lagging in the middle of a match.
  - Didn't get around to importing libperfmgr & lmkd again; not sure if I'm going to bother with it in 9.x or save that for crDroid 10.x/Android 14, since things seem to be doing so well now. But it's on the to-do list.
- "Misc tweaks & bugfixes." :D

Other notes / Known issues:
- Recommended GApps is my "elite build" NikGapps config. Download it from https://nikgapps.com/Terminator-J and enjoy. If you haven't updated the zip file in a while, you should get the 10 October or newer version and do the update from recovery using the latest NikGapps elite build zip.
- Audio (and probably a few other things) is always a little screwy at first boot after a clean install. Finish the initial setup wizard without restoring everything, and reboot as soon as possible. Then it nags you to complete setup, and you can restore all your stuff at that point. It'll be a lot happier.
- Bluetooth & NFC & even some mobile data functionality may be problematic compared to stock OxygenOS. With Android 13 and above, we *can't* just use the prebuilt QTI libs from vendor any more & have to use the source-built generic AOSP versions instead due to changes in how AOSP does things, and Qualcomm having dropped support for SDM845 two years ago.

Personal note:
- I have had a very busy & stressful summer and autumn so far, and I'm prioritizing family & work & real life in general over volunteer device maintaining. I'm sorry updates are late, but this is how it's going to go if I want to be able to continue doing this in the long term. But I haven't permanently dropped official support; we have some site automation & cleanup scripts that Gabriel runs periodically that will drop devices that have missed more than one version. Nothing tragic happened, thankfully!
