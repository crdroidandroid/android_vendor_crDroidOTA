crDroid 10.9
_Kernel 4.9, retrofit dynamic partitions, release-keys signed_

Changes since v10.8 (13 October) release:
- October 2024 Android Security Bulletins (android-14.0.0_r67) merged from upstream AOSP & LineageOS.
- Changes from upstream LineageOS:
  - I have no idea what all, but they're always hard at work doing amazing stuff that benefits everyone.
  - Pulled in the latest dummy libqti-perfd-client patches (not yet officially merged) from LineageOS gerrit.
  - Updated device-specific tree & kernel sources from lineage-21 branch as of mid October. Merged some stuff from general qcom_sdm845 kernel, updated proprietary blobs extract related stuff, nothing huge. Work has shiften to Android 15 bringup.
- Upstream changes from crDroid ROM sources:
  - Updated translations.
  - Fixes for some view errors with Pulse (lockscreen visualizer).
  - This might actually be a big deal; increased timeout for source-built AOSP NfcNci implementation to allow some cards to finish processing & respond. See https://github.com/crdroidandroid/android_packages_apps_Nfc/commit/9ea91f85671ef114f226bad36be8664caf931497 for more info.
  - Probably updated PocketMode again & more theme fixups & general framework optimizations... Let's get on to the important part!
- Device-specific things I can't stop screwing around with:
  - Switched back to the older/newer (last used circa February 2024) qcacld-3.0 kernel wifi driver version from bananafunction's work, and managed to figure out how to pull in updates from CodeLinaro (this is a nightmare fyi), because it seems to correctly support turning on the `gcmp_enable` flag in WCNSS_qcom_cfg.ini...
  - ... which is needed for the driver to correctly negotiate with WPA3 access points, rather than trying & failing repeatedly & getting itself flooded out by protected management frames as the access point repeatedly tries to upgrade connection security.
  - Undid the `pmf=0` flag again since it's no longer required to get full-speed connections. Now you can join WPA3-enabled networks again, without the 10x speed reduction from the last couple months! Woo!
  - Added a couple more flags that ShevT had in sm8150 (Oneplus 7-series) since they're using mostly the same kernel driver CLO tag, which also seem to get overnight power consumption by wifi back in line with how it is when using the "correct" driver version (which LineageOS is still using... with massive throughput losses).
  - Also undid some of the general-case (not MCC/MNC-specific) changes in CarrierConfig vendor.xml, since it seems to keep working without them, and some people have started having voice call issues or trouble with mobile data failing over to other modes in weird ways. Maybe it was that, maybe it was solar flares. Seems better again though according to the folks having trouble.
- "Misc bugfixes and improvements."
- Added new bugs so I'll have something to fix later. :D

Release Notes:
- If you get a "verification failed" error when trying to OTA update, it means you're coming from an older version that was using test-keys or older signing keys. You need to update from recovery in that case (does not require wiping data; does require a computer & working USB cable & platform-tools).
- TL;DR make sure you do the following setup steps or don't bother submitting bug reports:
  - Settings > System > Gestures > turn OFF "Lift to check phone" (use crDroid Settings > User Interface > Ambient Display settings instead).
  - Settings > Apps > Default Apps > tap the Gear (settings) icon next to crDroid Home (the default launcher) to open "Home settings" > Recents > turn OFF the "Shake phone to clear all tasks" toggle switch (it causes terrible SystemUI slowdowns & crashes after a couple hours).
  - [Optional if you use Oneplus Camera/Gallery] Go to https://gitlab.com/crdroidandroid/android_vendor_oneplus_apps/-/tree/14.0/sdm845/vendor/priv-app?ref_type=heads and download the APKs for OnePlusCamera and OnePlusGallery, then install them (it will ask you if you want to update the existing apps; choose yes each time).
  - [Optional if you use Oneplus Camera/Gallery] Go get this thing https://mega.nz/file/UHpDQS4L#FGKPas4_OM2Z5b5iE1R0zNZKUEa069uPJ7NAiluViXI and put it into Internal Storage > Android > obb > com.oneplus.gallery since it doesn't download correctly in-app due to sepolicy things I can't be bothered with in Android 14 (or don't if you don't care about OP Gallery being able to do image classification).
- To use "Device As Webcam" feature, connect USB to a computer, and in the USB mode notification, instead of "charging this device" or "File Transfer/Android Auto", choose the new "Webcam" option from the list. Ta da!
- You should probably just leave USB-OTG mode toggle on and let the USB Gadget HAL worry about it -- but it can be useful if USB port configuration gets stuck in an invalid state after using certain peripherals, or the port connector is failing and has intermittent connection problems; unplug & turn toggle off & back on to fix.
- Force USB 2.0 Fastcharge mode toggle will let you increase requested charging current *when connected to a computer or hub* to 900mA, up from 500. It also breaks DASH charging and possibly other Qualcomm quick charging methods when enabled, so don't forget to turn it off again afterwards for better compatibility with most charging bricks.

Known issues:
_Look, none of this is really deal-breaking for most people. Things work well as a daily driver, all major systems work as they should as far as I can tell (or at least as well as in upstream LineageOS), battery life tends to be average-to-great depending on usage, etc._
- Upstream crDroid/LineageOS/Qualcomm/Google issues:
  - SAFETYNET/PLAY INTEGRITY MAY NOT PASS. It's a cat & mouse game, and they can change the rules on their end at any time, and have been doing so frequently. This is not considered a bug. The ROM devs try this or that strategy, and it takes me forever to get updates releases pushed, and then it's out of date by the time you get it. Sorry. Hate Google, not me. Change to a better bank & use the website instead of a crappy "app", and complain loudly while you threaten to take your money somewhere else that doesn't make broken apps requiring Google's spyware in order to function.
  - As of Android 13, we're using the source-built AOSP implementations for bluetooth & NFC, since it's not possible to continue with the old prebuilt QTI vendor blobs & implementation. Some things don't work as well; nothing I can do about it.
  - The "QR Code Scanner" lockscreen shortcut option does not get enabled for use until you add the "QR Scanner" QS tile & use it. (not sure if this is still true?)
  - Wallpapers & Styles can cause a SystemUI crash if you swap clock faces & colors too rapidly, too many times before settling on something. It's a stupid/funny reason, I hope devs can figure out what to DO about it. (not sure if this is still true?)
  - Using "Hold handle to search" feature in Gesture Navigation settings is basically broken.
  - If you use Google One/Google Drive for automatic system backups, then Seedvault is gonna complain at you after every reboot about not being able to run a backup. Connect USB to computer & open a terminal (or install a terminal emulator like termux from f-droid) and run the following command: `pm disable-user --user 0 com.stevesoltys.seedvault` to disable Seedvault, since apparently it doesn't know when it's not wanted.
  - Some apps/games cannot connect to their servers on mobile data with certain carrier SIMs (many games on MetroPCS in the US, and Reliance/JIO in India, etc). This seems to be common to LineageOS-based custom ROMs on this device. OxygenOS used Google's carrier info/config stack and still works nearly 3 years later, and current Pixel-based ROMs that use Google's stack seem to work fine. I have no idea how to fix this, definitely above my pay grade.
  - Lockscreen layout for Face Unlock instructions is overlapped by UDFPS circle in crDroid 10.7. Hopefully has been fixed in more recent ROM sources since issue was reported, but I kind of don't care because in my opinion nobody should use this feature and I will not spend time trying to troubleshoot it. If I get complaints, I'll just remove the feature entirely, because bad security (leading to false sense of security) is arguably worse than no security.
- crDroid OP6/6T-specific issues:
  - Go do the setup things in the Release Notes section; really. Or else I will ignore your bug reports. So there.
  - Some USB gamepads seem to no longer work? Dunno if this is due to USB Gadget implementation for DeviceAsWebcam support or what. One user reported that their Backbone USB-C no longer works in 10.7, but I can't really tell what's up from the logs. My 8BitDo gamepads still work fine while directly attached via USB-C and connecting via Bluetooth, so I know it's not just broken globally. Might have to set/change USB privacy mode in "Trust" or set a different default USB mode in Developer Options or just unplug & reconnect a few times?
  - One person seems to have doubled-up icons on lock screen. Can't reproduce, but might be a combination of settings with different icon packs or fonts or lockscreen styles. Try clearing your Settings or crDroid Settings app storage, reboot, and re-set preferences if you face this issue.
  - For some people, the "update app with same version of app but installed as user" approach to fixing OnePlus Camera doesn't work and it STILL has black screen on app launch & crashes shortly thereafter. I don't know why, and don't have time to fix. It's an ugly hack in the first place, and I don't have time to make it better right now.
