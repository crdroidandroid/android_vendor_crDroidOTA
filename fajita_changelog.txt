crDroid 10.2

Changes since v10.1 (21 January) release:
- February 2024 Android Security Bulletin (android-14.0.0_r25) merged from upstream AOSP & LineageOS.
- Upstream changes from LineageOS:
  - Rebased on early-mid February lineage-21 branches for our devices.
  - Updated Dialer finally implemented, woo.
  - I actually don't know how many of the "new for lineage-21.0" apps we managed to include in this release; see below.
- Upstream changes from crDroid ROM sources:
  - Custom UDFPS animations are back & working again on fajita, woo!
  - Updated PPU spoofing fingerprint, which is probably outdated again by this point. Good luck.
  - Probably a lot more fixes & changes by the ROM dev team.
- Device-specific:
  - Reverted to using older build fingerprints with ih8sn; it seemed to help a few people that way.
  - Back to boring "-perf" kernel localversion string because Google are jerks.
  - Against my better judgment I re-added OnePlus Camera & Gallery. I haven't done a lot to try and figure out why the OnePlus Gallery app can't download the expansion file in Android 14 sometimes.
  - "Misc tweaks & bugfixes." :D (look, a lot of stuff.)

General notes:
- I probably need to make a 10.2 "hotfix" build soon, since all lot of things have changed since I created this build (including probably yet another spoofing device fingerprint). But sitting on it longer won't help anything either. So off we go to release!
- I'm busy af right now in real life. It never seems to stop. That makes it really hard to keep up when things like this are going on that will impact our devices dramatically going forward:
  - This build was made just before the official promotion of LineageOS to Android 14.0.
  - There's a lot changing in crDroid ROM sources, and it seemed like things were unstable for a couple weeks after I made this build. Some of that is due to...
  - The release of "lineage-21.0" officially upstream in LineageOS, and associated changes there. I had actually synced my build tree BEFORE this went live, so I don't know how many of the "new" Lineage 21 apps I have included. It effectively became a mid-month rebase for the crDroid dev team however, in order to reconcile so many changes within LineageOS (which we are based upon very closely).
  - With 14.0 QPR2 & March ASB just around the corner, that might force us to migrate to using the 4.19 kernel base & associated patches that EdwinMoq has been working on for months & months. I've got it working pretty well here, but it's time-consuming to deal with, there's a lot of things like DeviceExtras that I haven't brought up yet using my 4.19-based trees, and "time to work on this volunteer hobby" is what I don't have right now.
  - Unfortunately, you actually can't just apply a 4.19 build over a 4.9 installation without a factory reset; the FBE encryption driver is set up differently in the newer kernel and requires a wipe. So figuring out how to make that break is yet another thing to deal with; and I don't have time.
- So I don't know what the future holds. I'd love to put out kernel 4.19-based builds, but I might literally have to create new "enchilada-4.19" and "fajita-4.19" devices in order to make sure that nobody gets their installation killed by a 4.19 OTA being released for a 4.9 device. And it takes time (and a lot of drive space!) to implement that properly and keep the namespaces separated and everything.


Known issues:
- Look, none of this is really deal-breaking for most people. Things work well as a daily driver, all major systems work as they should as far as I can tell (or at least as well as in upstream LineageOS).
- Upstream crDroid/LineageOS/Qualcomm/Google issues:
  - Blurs are very resource-intensive, and I can't disable them by default while keeping the capability intact. For best experience & battery life, go to Settings > Display and disable "window-level blurs". If you want it to look pretty without too much lag/stutter, go to Settings > DeviceExtras and turn "AdrenoBoost" all the way up to 3, but be aware this will consume more battery.
  - SAFETYNET/PLAY INTEGRITY IS PROBABLY NOT GOING TO PASS FOR GOOGLE PAY/WALLET, AND MIGHT BE BROKEN ELSEWHERE. Google has been on a rampage against custom ROMs and unlocked bootloaders being able to spoof Play Integrity in a meaningful way, and seems to be requiring hardware-backed integrity (which is currently not spoofable) for Pay/Wallet. It has always been a cat & mouse game, and they can change the rules on their end at any time. Currently a new install will show up with "Device Certified" in Play Store, but that might change any time and is not considered a bug.
  - As of Android 13, we're using the source-built AOSP implementations for bluetooth & NFC, since it's not possible to continue with the old prebuilt QTI vendor blobs & implementation. Some things don't work as well; nothing I can do about it.
  - The "QR Code Scanner" lockscreen shortcut option does not get enabled for use until you add the "QR Scanner" QS tile.
  - Wallpapers & Styles can cause a SystemUI crash if you swap clock faces & colors too rapidly, too many times before settling on something. It's a stupid/funny reason, I hope devs can figure out what to DO about it. (not sure if this is still true?)
  - In landscape mode, the "split shade" code was changed in 10.2 and notifications might not appear (just grey rectangles where they should be). Go into "Settings > crDroid Settings > QS Tiles" and change the "Quick QS" columns or rows in landscape to something not-default (3 columns or 2 rows or something) and it should resolve. Might even work if you do that, back out of the setting, then set it back to defaults. I don't know; it's weird now because of changes above my pay grade.
- crDroid OP6/6T-specific issues:
  - VP9 video playback has problems in Android 14 on sdm845 devices using the qcom-caf sdm845 media HAL & qualcomm hardware accelerated decoder. Disabling the hardware-accelerated decoder allows apps like YouTube & Instagram that change stream format mid-session to work correctly again, although playback of 1440p & 4K VP9-compressed content now requires software decoding fallback. TL;DR: you might need to use NewPipe to download 4K videos & VLC to play them now. This isn't just our device; anything using sdm845 or sdm710 or older is going to have problems in Android 14 with VP9 video format decoding in hardware, but whether a maintainer chooses to "fix" it by making it fall back to software decoding is going to be device-specific, so I'll put it here (since I did).
  - You should go into crDroid Home (default launcher) settings and disable "Shake to clear recents" feature. It seems buggy with our device's sensor implementation & causes bad lag/slowdown after a while when trying to switch apps/see recents/navigate home.

Build type: Monthly (-ish)
