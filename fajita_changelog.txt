crDroid 10.0

Initial Official Android 14 release:
- December 2023 Android Security Bulletin (android-14.0.0_r17) merged from AOSP.
- Imported current lineage-21 branches of our device-specific files (device trees, hardware/oneplus components, kernel, and vendor blobs):
  - Including some stuff EdwinMoq is waiting for approval for in the LOS Gerrit.
  - We're now including firmware built-in! So just get updated to OOS 11.1.2.2 in one slot, then proceed with flashing, and it will update the destination slot. Fantastic!
- Device-specific:
  - We're now shipping with retrofitted dynamic partitions (and compressed vendor filesystem image), in order to free up ~700MB of additional space for larger Google Apps packages! Please do not panic. It's a one-time conversion procedure that involves things you should already have, and a couple additional fastboot commands. After that, updating will be the same as it ever was.
  - FINALLY making the switch to AOSP libperfmgr and lmkd for performance/memory management. It tends to be a little smoother, at the expense of a little bit of battery life, compared to sticking with QTI perfd. However, we'll have to make the jump to kernel 4.19 within a few months anyway, so might as well get used to it now (and maybe work on tuning the scheduler in kernel instead).
  - Updated kernel commits from bananafunction.
  - Compiling kernel with clang 17.0.4.
  - No OnePlus Camera or Gallery (yet...? dunno yet).
  - DeviceExtras tidied up & working well.
  - Tons of tidying & cleanup & making sure the changes over stock LineageOS actually DO something useful.

Known issues:
- Upstream crDroid/LineageOS/Qualcomm/Google issues:
  - Blurs are very resource-intensive, and I can't disable them by default while keeping the capability intact. For best experience & battery life, go to Settings > Display and disable "window-level blurs". If you want it fancy but more battery-hungry, leave blurs enabled and go to Settings > DeviceExtras and turn "AdrenoBoost" all the way up to 3 instead.
  - Google has been on a rampage against custom ROMs and unlocked bootloaders being able to spoof Play Integrity in a meaningful way, and seems to be requiring hardware-backed integrity ("strong integrity", which is currently not spoofable) for Pay/Wallet. It has always been a cat & mouse game, and they can change the rules on their end at any time. Currently a new install will show up with "Device Certified" in Play Store, but will probably fail to allow Pay/Wallet to be enabled once you install that. This is not considered a bug; if a ROM-wide fix becomes available, it'll be incorporated.
  - Media playback has problems in Android 14 on sdm845 devices using the generic lineage qcom sdm845 kernel base; where changing resolution/bitrate/stream parameters in the same stream instance fails to continue playback across the "jump" (like with YouTube when trying to switch between ads). This is most noticeable in YouTube. I cannot recommend NewPipe enough as an alternative, until a solution is found (like update to kernel 4.19 & media HALs gets finalized).
  - As of Android 13, we're using the source-built AOSP implementations for bluetooth & NFC, since it's not possible to continue with the old prebuilt QTI vendor blobs & implementation. Some things don't work as well; nothing I can do about it.
  - The "QR Code Scanner" lockscreen shortcut option does not get enabled for use until you add the "QR Scanner" QS tile.
  - Choosing a different color for Notification/Charging LED in crDroid Settings works, but the crDroid Settings activity crashes afterward when you hit "Ok" on the color picker modal dialog. The devs know & have logs, they'll get to it (not exclusive to enchilada, happens to any device with color notification/charging LED).
- crDroid OP6/6T-specific issues:
  - Our haptic feedback implementation continues to suck. Thanks, Qualcomm, for the crappy kernel driver that your AIDL interface hardly talks to and was effectively abandoned one year later when sm8150 came out!
  - I dunno, it's actually really really good right now! All the issues I can think of are basically not device-specific, but functions of ROM source or decisions that Google & Qualcomm & OnePlus have made.
