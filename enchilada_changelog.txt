crDroid 10.0

Initial Android 14 release:
- November 2023 Android Security Bulletin (android-14.0.0_r14) merged from AOSP.
- Imported current lineage-21 branches of our device-specific files (device trees, hardware/oneplus components, kernel, and vendor blobs):
  - Including some stuff EdwinMoq is waiting for approval for in the LOS Gerrit.
  - We're now including firmware built-in! So just get updated to OOS 11.1.2.2 in one slot, then proceed with flashing, and it will update the destination slot. Fantastic!
- Device-specific:
  - Still using QTI perfd & kernel lmk driver, with kernel 4.9 for now. We're doing extensive testing of a move to libperfmgr & lmkd, but for official releases at the moment, sticking with what's known to work well & be a good balance of battery & performance.
  - Updated kernel commits from bananafunction.
  - Compiling kernel with clang 17.0.4.
  - We're now shipping with retrofitted dynamic partitions (and compressed vendor filesystem image), in order to free up ~700MB of additional space for larger Google Apps packages! Please do not panic. It's a one-time conversion procedure that involves things you should already have, and a couple additional fastboot commands. After that, updating will be the same as it ever was.
  - No OnePlus Camera or Gallery (yet...? dunno yet).
  - DeviceExtras tidied up & working well.
  - Tons of tidying & cleanup & making sure the changes over stock LineageOS actually DO something useful.
  
Known issues:
- Upstream crDroid/LineageOS/Qualcomm/Google issues:
  - Blurs are very resource-intensive, and I can't disable them by default while keeping the capability intact. For best experience & battery life, go to Settings > Display and disable "window-level blurs". If you want it to look pretty without too much lag/stutter, go to Settings > DeviceExtras and turn "AdrenoBoost" all the way up to 3, but be aware this will consume more battery.
  - Google has been on a rampage against custom ROMs and unlocked bootloaders being able to spoof Play Integrity in a meaningful way, and seems to be requiring hardware-backed integrity (which is currently not spoofable) for Pay/Wallet. It has always been a cat & mouse game, and they can change the rules on their end at any time. Currently a new install will show up with "Device Certified" in Play Store, but that might change any time and is not considered a bug.
  - Media playback has problems in Android 14 on sdm845 devices using the generic lineage qcom sdm845 kernel base; where changing resolution/bitrate/stream parameters in the same stream instance fails to continue playback across the "jump" (like with YouTube when trying to switch between ads). This is most noticeable in YouTube. I cannot recommend NewPipe enough as an alternative, until a solution is found (like update to kernel 4.19 & media HALs gets finalized).
  - As of Android 13, we're using the source-built AOSP implementations for bluetooth & NFC, since it's not possible to continue with the old prebuilt QTI vendor blobs & implementation. Some things don't work as well; nothing I can do about it.
  - The "QR Code Scanner" lockscreen shortcut option does not get enabled for use until you add the "QR Scanner" QS tile.
- crDroid OP6/6T-specific issues:
  - It's... actually really good right now. Time to merge 14.0 QPR1 and ruin everything! :D
