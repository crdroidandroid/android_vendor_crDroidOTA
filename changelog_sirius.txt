- Fixed LED. Now we have three cases:
1) Attention (uses the maximum brightness of LED and it blinks faster than in notification case). Only used when the battery is under 15%.
2) Notification (the LED blinks until you check QS for notification)
3) Battery (the LED just turn on)
I wrote them in there priority, so, the example:
Your phone is on charger (the LED is just on), you are getting message (the LED started to blink until you check QS for notification).
