crDroid 9.10

Changelog since v9.9 (15 October) release:
- October 2023 Android Security Bulletin (android-13.0.0_r75) merged from AOSP.
- Upstream changes to ROM sources from LineageOS & crDroid merged.
- crDroid:
  - A number of fixes for some bugs here & there including QS tile layout, long-swipes in navigation gestures, statusbar logo customization...
  - ...and a fix for a massive power drain that happens as a side effect of our PixelProps spoofing in framework once the security patch level gets too old and GMS (Google Play Services) starts trying to download an update that it's CERTAIN exists because, after all, we're a Pixel! Annnnd there's no update to download because we're not a Pixel. Wow. No wonder the issue always appeared to be fixed during testing every month, then came back by the time I got ready to release.
- Any device-specific device trees/hardware/kernel/vendor changes pulled from LineageOS.
  - There's been some little fixes & tweaks going on, and some cleanup in kernel especially that resolves some issues with newer clang versions (yay).
- Device-specific:
  - Lots of cleanup and getting rid of extra stuff that wasn't helping or was actively hurting; prepping for Android 14 benefits everyone!
  - Updated kernel commits from bananafunction's lineage-20-test branch.
  - Added slider to allow control of flar2's AdrenoBoost kernel driver so you can make it ramp up GPU sooner/longer in response to touch & utilization (gives you a way to control performance/responsiveness vs battery life a little more).
  - Didn't get around to importing libperfmgr & lmkd yet again; not sure if I'm going to bother with it in 9.x or save that for crDroid 10.x/Android 14, since things seem to be doing so well now. But it's on the to-do list.
- "Misc tweaks & bugfixes." :D

Other notes / Known issues:
- Recommended GApps is my "elite build" NikGapps config. Download it from https://nikgapps.com/Terminator-J and enjoy. If you haven't updated the zip file in a while, you should get the 10 October or newer version and do the update from recovery using the latest NikGapps elite build zip.
- Audio (and probably a few other things) is always a little screwy at first boot after a clean install. Finish the initial setup wizard without restoring everything, and reboot as soon as possible. Then it nags you to complete setup, and you can restore all your stuff at that point. It'll be a lot happier.
- Bluetooth & NFC & even some mobile data functionality may be problematic compared to stock OxygenOS. With Android 13 and above, we *can't* just use the prebuilt QTI libs from vendor any more & have to use the source-built generic AOSP versions instead due to changes in how AOSP does things, and Qualcomm having dropped support for SDM845 two years ago.
- For some reason the "QR Code Scanner" lockscreen shortcut option is greyed-out until you add the "QR Scanner" QS tile; then it becomes available & works. ROM devs know, low-priority issue I guess.
- My Mazda is having some serious problems with low power below ~3000rpm. If anyone wants to pay me to take a couple weeks off work so I can put the car in the shop & work on the ROM, that'd be awesome.
